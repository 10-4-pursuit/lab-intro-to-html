    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk all of the Spice Rub seasonings together in a small bowl. Remove 1 ½ tablespoons Spice Rub to a large bowl along with 2 cups buttermilk and 2 bay leaves. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours up to overnight.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, remove 1 teaspoon Spice Rub to a medium bowl for your Nashville Hot Sauce. Stir in all remaining Nashville Hot Sauce ingredients except butter (the oil will look separated which is okay). </li>
        <li>Prepare your Buttermilk Egg Wash by whisking 2 eggs together with 1 cup buttermilk and ¼ cup hot sauce in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Prepare Flour Breading by whisking 3 ½ cups flour, 1 tablespoon baking powder and all remaining Spice Rub spices together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Working with 1 piece of chicken at a time, dredge chicken in Flour, shake of any excess, coat in Buttermilk Egg Wash, shake of any excess, then dredge once more in Flour, shake of any excess and place chicken on a baking rack. Repeat until all chicken is coated.</li>
        <li>Add enough vegetable oil to your Dutch oven until oil measures 3” deep. Heat over medium high heat until oil registers 375 degrees F. Add 3-4 chicken pieces to your Dutch oven in a single layer, cover, and cook 7 minutes. Flip chicken over, cover and continue to fry until chicken’s internal temperature reaches 160 degrees or 165 degrees for dark meat, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove fried chicken to paper towel lined baking sheet. Repeat until all chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, vigorously whisk in melted butter to your Nashville Hot Sauce until smooth. Let chicken cool slightly then brush with desired amount of Sauce. You can adjust the spiciness of your chicken by simply adding more or less Nashville Hot Sauce.</li>
    </ol>
