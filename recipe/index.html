        <figcaption>The dessert originates from La Viña, a cafe in the resort town of San Sebastian in the Basque region of
            Spain. In 1990, Chef Santiago Rivera embarked on an experiment to make a new type of cake every day. Eventually,
            he developed the Basque cheesecake recipe.</figcaption>

    <h2> What is Basque Cheesecake? </h2>
    <p>Unlike classic New York cheesecake,<strong> Burnt Basque cheesecake</strong> isn’t <em>smooth or dense</em>; instead,
    the dessert—baked at a high temperature—is light and scorched and caramelized on the top with a rich, gooey interior. <em>Made with cream
    cheese, sugar, and eggs, Basque cheesecakes don’t have a crust, giving it a similar feel to a mousse.</em> Its outer
    edges are typically wrinkled and nonuniform, thanks to cooking the cheesecake in parchment paper.</p>

    <h2> Finally, the Basque Cheesecake Recipe </h2>
    <hr />
    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Two lbs of cream cheese</li>
        <li>1½ cups sugar</li>
        <li>6 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Directions </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400° F and prepare your 10-inch pan. First grease the sides of the pan with unsalted
            butter,
            then line it with two sheets of parchment paper. The paper should overlap to form a double thickness. You'll
            have to
            wrinkle and crease the parchment paper to make it fit into the round pan, which creates the irregular shape of a
            Basque cheesecake.</li>
        <li>In the large bowl of a stand mixer, beat together the cream cheese and sugar at medium-low speed, scraping the
            sides
            of the bowl as needed. Beat for about 2 minutes, until you smooth out all lumps.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, while beating at medium speed and wait 15 seconds before adding each egg. Beat
            another
            10 seconds or so, until the batter is creamy and silky.</li>
        <li>Add the heavy cream, kosher salt, and vanilla extract. Beat at medium-low for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Sift the all-purpose flour over the cream cheese mixture, then beat at low for about 30 seconds and scrape the
            sides
            of the bowl as needed. Stop beating when the batter is very smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, until the cheesecake is deep brown on top. Pull
            it
            out of the oven while still a bit jiggly in the middle.</li>
        <li>Let the cheesecake cool slightly before removing the sides of the springform pan. It will fall quite a bit as it
            cools. Take the pan sides off, then let the cake cool completely. Peel away the parchment paper only after the
            cheesecake has reached room temp. It's okay to make this cheesecake ahead of time and refrigerate it overnight,
            but
            take it out of the refrigerator several hours before you plan to serve it.</li>
