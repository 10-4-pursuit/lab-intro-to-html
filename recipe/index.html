        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>To live mindfully is to live in the moment and reawaken oneself to the present, rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. 
            <br>
            To be mindful is to observe and label thoughts, feelings, sensations in the body in an objective manner. 
            <br>
            Below we will share the reciped for living in mindfulness.

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>I feel that in continually living from my deepest intentions (feeling connected to myself and others, transforming fear to love), I no longer need to script or mould my life to meet some sort of ideal.</li>
    <li>I see the beauty in all things, and I no longer try to make myself perfect.</li>
    <li>I used to think that I had to get somewhere, to fix myself in some way, to be happy, to be whole. Now I no longer see this as necessary. </li>
</ol>
