    <h1>Sundial</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the <em>free</em> encyclopedia.</p>
    <p>A <strong>sundial measures time by the position of the sun.</strong> The most commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours of the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow changes. However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object casts a predictable shadow. Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time. Minor design variations can measure standard and daylight saving time, as well.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC) are <strong>known from ancient Egypt,</strong> and were developed further by other cultures, including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman cultures. A type of sundial without gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:2).</p>
